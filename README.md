## Hi there I'm Chloe

I'm a web developer currently working with:

- Vanilla JS
- SQL

I'm working my way through the web development and full stack engineer path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)

I've had some PR contributions for JavaScript accepted through the Codecademy docs repo including for getFullYear method [here](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/dates/getFullYear). It was a great learning curve to understand how these processes work. It was not as intimidating as it seems at first and it is definitely something I wish to get more involved with in the future as my skills improve.
